#This a Matlab code which shows the error in values while calculating Macluarin Series for e raised to x.
- This code will Calculate the error and the plot it on the graph.
- Values of x are discrete and are 0.1,0.05,0.02 and 0.01.
- The graph is plotted for in three conditions :-
    1-When only one term of Macluarin series is used for calculating values of e raised to x.
    2-When only two terms of Macluarin series is used for calculating values of e raised to x.
    3-When only three terms of Macluarin series is used for calculating values of e raised to x.
